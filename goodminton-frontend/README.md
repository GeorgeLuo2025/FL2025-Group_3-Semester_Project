## Objectives
This app serves to inform and connect local badminton communities who want to meet other players, find courts to play on, play matches, find the right tools, join local groups and spend more time on the court.

### Key Functionalities: 
- Search for nearby courts; check for ratings for courts; add ratings/comments to courts
- Create posts, events, and tournaments + comment
- Find users and message them (? may be removed ?)
- Join and create groups
- Track personal badminton statistics (wins/losses/game stats)
- View information on equipment, add ratings/comments to equipment

### Tech Stack:
 - Frontend: React Native with Expo
 - Backend: Node.js
 - Database: Mongo DB

## How to Run

### Frontend Setup:
1. **Install Node.js and npm**  
   - Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (if not already downloaded).

2. **Install Expo CLI**  
   - Open your terminal and run:  
     `npm install -g expo-cli`

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   - Run:  
     `cd [replace this with how the project is named on your computer]` 

5. **Install Project Dependencies**  
   - In the project directory, run:  
     `npm install`

### Running the Frontend (need to do this everytime):

1. **Start the Expo Development Server**  
   - In the project directory (see step 4) run:  
     `npm start`  
   - This will open the Expo Dev Tools in your browser.

2. **Run the App on Your Device or Simulator**  
   - **On a physical device:**  
     - Download the Expo Go app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android).
     - Scan the QR code in Expo Dev Tools with the Expo Go app.
   - **On an emulator/simulator:**  
     - For iOS: Press `i` in the terminal to open in the iOS Simulator (requires Xcode Tools). I'm using the emulator for Iphone 15 currently.
     - For Android: Press `a` in the terminal to open in an Android emulator (requires Android Studio).

3. **Troubleshooting**  
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed and your device/emulator is set up. (repeat step 4 from setup) 

4. **Stop the Development Server**  
   - Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal to stop Expo.
